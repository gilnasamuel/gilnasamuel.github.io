SDE at A'Air. Formerly FSD at Bloomberg. Graduated PhD RPI'18; BA Bard'11. Both in computer science. I studied topic modeling, non-negative matrix factorization, and privacy in distributed machine learning.

I'm happy to be done with grad school. Work is pretty fun and it's nice to have the ability to context switch and work on small projects and just enjoy the world.
