Recently I gave a short talk to first-year PhD students in RPI's computer science department. The talk was supposed to be about my own research, but since I only had a short amount of time I didn't want to get into the details. I wanted to frame the talk in a way that would be interesting and have concrete take-aways for the first years. I decided to try and define what makes a good research topic for a PhD, and use myself as a case study of bad and good choices.

As an undergraduate you learn how to answer questions in your field, sometimes even challenging questions. But usually the questions are handed to you because they've stood the test of time. As a student doing research, you can get lucky and work with an advisor who has a nice question ready to go and puts you to work on answering the question right away. This scenario is more likely for undergraduate researchers, and masters students. However as a PhD student it's more likely your advisor has an area of interest, or a question they believe has potential but are unsure about, and they will ask you to investigate.

When 'investigating' your task is two-fold: condense the potentially nebulous question, and look for answers. My goal is to provide features that students can use to evaluate research areas in search of their PhD research topic. These are the features that seem most important to me looking back:

### Future Relevance: will the topic be actively worked on 4-7 years from now?

You will need a job when you graduate. As a result the question you pick can't be too easy to answer. Otherwise it will be "solved" and shipped as a python module before you graduate. If that's inevitable, you want to be the one publishing the module. Hint: security is an unsolvable problem; it can't be delivered in a module. Can you think of other unsolvable problems?

### Generalizability: does the topic have varying problem settings or applications?

If you work on a niche problem most likely none of your peers will care about your research, and it will be hard to find jobs. Of course you could have gotten lucky and worked on convolutional neural networks in 2008...

### Optimal Substructure: can the problem be broken down into digestible parts?

It's much better to answer 10 little questions, 1 per semester, than to try and answer 1 big question in 5 years. Furthermore, finding questions that you believe you can answer--where you know what the first step should be--is a key for motivation. Staying motivated throughout your PhD is one of the most important things to your success. The reason is because it's very hard to keep grinding away at research when you don't have feedback. Getting feedback/progress on multiple little questions is great, and being able to switch to a different question if you get stuck is also a great boon.

### Resources: can you get a competitive advantage for this topic?

If someone doesn't have access to a state-of-the-art robot, it's unlikely they will be the first to develop algorithms for robots doing cartwheels. So the questions you want to ask are: does my advisor have useful prior knowledge in this area? Do I? Are there courses at my school I can take that will give me useful tools? (aside: learning and developing tools is important; they allow you to speak and think in a more expressive language, so that you can formulate more complex ideas easily) Can I consult with other professors or labs at my school? Does my school have access to hardware/software/data that will allow me to answer more interesting questions?
